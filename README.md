Introducing the **Project Fluently**, the goal of this project is to create the best Stable Diffusion models, now we have several powerful models, you can find them [here](https://huggingface.co/fluently?sort_models=likes#models).

---

## What we do and what we have created

We create Stable Diffusion models, train them and merge them. We make both SD1.5 models and SDXL models.

#### List of Fluently family models:

*(SDXL):*
- [Fluently XL Final](https://huggingface.co/fluently/Fluently-XL-Final)
- [Fluently XL v4](https://huggingface.co/fluently/Fluently-XL-v4)
- [Fluently XL v3](https://huggingface.co/fluently/Fluently-XL-v3)
- [Fluently XL v3 Lightning](https://huggingface.co/fluently/Fluently-XL-v3-Lightning)
- [Fluently XL v3-inpainting](https://huggingface.co/fluently/Fluently-XL-v3-inpainting)
- [Fluently XL v2](https://huggingface.co/fluently/Fluently-XL-v2)
- [Fluently XL v1](https://huggingface.co/fluently/Fluently-XL-v1)

### Community

We hope to develop our community, right now you can improve our models, be a contributor on GitHub and offer your ideas. [Here](#the-best-community-projects) we will publish the best developments from the community for Fluently.

#### Test - **Fluently XL v2** ***VS*** Popular XL-models

## End

In the end, we want to say that we are only trying to develop the Stable Diffusion models, you are generating more and more beautiful images every day, you are truly developing neural networks and developing yourself. Have a nice day and successful generation!!
